# #TWSThreeTierAppChallenge

## Overview
This repository hosts the `#TWSThreeTierAppChallenge` for the TWS community. 
The challenge involves deploying a Three-Tier Web Application using ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB, with deployment on AWS EKS. Participants are encouraged to deploy the application, add creative enhancements, and submit a Pull Request (PR). Merged PRs will earn exciting prizes!


## Challenge Steps
- [Application Code](#application-code)
- [Jenkins Pipeline Code](#jenkins-pipeline-code)
- [Jenkins Server Terraform](#jenkins-server-terraform)
- [Kubernetes Manifests Files](#kubernetes-manifests-files)
- [Project Details](#project-details)

## Application Code
The `Application-Code` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the frontend and backend implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the `Jenkins-Pipeline-Code` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts. These scripts automate the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth integration and deployment of your application.

## Jenkins Server Terraform
Explore the `Jenkins-Server-TF` directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins Server on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files
The `Kubernetes-Manifests-Files` directory holds Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application on AWS EKS. Understand and customize these files to suit your project needs.
